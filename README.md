# Canny-edge-detection-and-Harris-Corner-Detection-from-scratch  
This was an assignment from the course 3D Computer Vision at IIT Gandhinagar. This course was taught by Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman (Scholar link: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3YWptB8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)  

The assignment demonstrates the Canny edge Detection and Harris Corner Detection from scratch.  

There are two folders:
1) canny_edge_detection
2) harris_corner_detection 

each folder contains 5 folders for the manual results produced for the 5 images,one folder(inbuilt_outputs) for the results produced using the inbuilt function in opencv and the .ipynb file of the code written 

The 5 images used for canny and harris are present in the corresponding results folders

TO RUN THE CODE:
move to the markdown where "RUN THE CODE IN THE BELOW CELL" is written
provide the path to the image: The image can be in RGB or grayscale

to run the built in function move to the markdown "BUILT-IN"

NOTE: It is always preferred to take a look at the results after saving the image.
